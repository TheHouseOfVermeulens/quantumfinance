    <h1>Quantum Finance topics with Werner Vermeulen PhD candidate.</h1>

        Readers and practitioners of my papers can make use of the research and the new knowledge, it has generated by using the methodology and results obtained to i.e. better understand Quantum Annealing in combinatorial portfolio optimization. By beginning to solve these types of problems now, my readers begin building core skills and expertise around combinatorial optimization, QUBO modelling, problem decomposition for hybrid computing applications, and other advanced optimization problem-solving techniques specific to these new classes of computing hardware and software. Importantly, these skills and competencies are highly transferable. In fact, the QUBOs themselves are highly reusable for solving optimization problems with quantum computers. This means getting started developing, iterating and deploying advanced QUBOs for enterprise-class optimization problems now, pushing innovation further, and driving real and often transformative outcomes in the business today.  
    <br>When production-grade quantum computers finally arrive, my readers (junior team members) can redeploy the same QUBO models on the new systems and leap frog even further, having already developed the enterprise competencies to embrace these new systems in earnest. Anything less is both a business and technology risk because competitors will surely be one step ahead.
