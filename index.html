    <h1>Quantum Finance topics with Werner Vermeulen PhD candidate.</h1>

I am a Professional PhD candidate in Switzerland with practical experience in Quantum Finance for Financial Engineers and I am currently writing my online dissertation on a potential Quantum Financial Engineering topic of interest to you. Furthermore, I am a US Masters of Science in Financial Engineering graduate with an accumulated average of 91% (full accreditation in all US States). I have collaborated and contributed to numerous Quantum Finance topics to Financial Engineering problems, including my Capstone Project on NP-complete, Quantum Portfolio optimization problems, using D-Wave Annealer 2000Q and other simulated annealers during the two year period. I have received 21 peer reviews on my case studies / micro-papers to date also during this time. Readers and practitioners of my paper(s) can make use of the research and the new knowledge, it has generated by using the methodology and results obtained to i.e. better understand Quantum Annealing in combinatorial portfolio optimization. By beginning to solve these types of problems now, my readers (junior team members) and I begin building core skills and expertise at Moody's Analytics Quantum Computing around combinatorial optimization, QUBO modelling, problem decomposition for hybrid computing applications, and other advanced optimization problem-solving techniques specific to these new classes of computing hardware and software. Importantly, these skills and competencies are highly transferable. In fact, the QUBOs themselves are highly reusable for solving optimization problems with quantum computers. This means getting started developing, iterating and deploying advanced QUBOs for enterprise-class optimization problems now, pushing innovation further, and driving real and often transformative outcomes in the business today.  

When production-grade quantum computers finally arrive, my readers (junior team members) and I can redeploy the same QUBO models on the new systems and leap frog even further, having already developed the enterprise competencies to embrace these new systems in earnest. Anything less is both a business and technology risk because competitors will surely be one step ahead.
